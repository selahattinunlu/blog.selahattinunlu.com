We can use throttle to decrease call number.\nLet’s imagine you’re running a function when the mouse is moved. So, everytime you’ll run the function.\nYou might want to limit it with 2 seconds. The method will be runned only every 2 seconds while mouse is moving.\nYou limited it and decreased to call size.</p>\n<p>If we want to <em>defer</em> a function call until an event is done, we need to use <em>debouncing</em>.\nThere is a quick example for it. Let’s image you want to make a search box that it will give the suggest\nto the user according to typed text. Will you make a query in your database when user hit to the keyboard everytime? Of course, no! Because it’ll hurt your database, right? You need to defer making query until the user stopped to typing.\nYou can say, make a query when if user does not type anything in 500ms. It’s <em>debouncing</em>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Throttle</em> will run every <em>X</em> time.</p>\n<p><em>Debounce</em> will run only once when an event is done.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There is also great demo to fully demostrate how they work.</p>\n<p>You can check it out: <a href=\"http://demo.nimius.net/debounce_throttle/\">Throttle-Debounce Demo</a></p>"}
