We can use the throttle to decrease the number of calls.\nLet’s imagine you’re running a function when the mouse is moved. So, everytime the function will run.\nYou might want to limit it to run every 2 seconds. The function will run only every 2 seconds while mouse is moving.\nYou limited it and decreased the number of calls.</p>\n<p>If we want to <strong>defer</strong> a function call until an event is completed, we need to use <strong>debouncing</strong>.\nThere is a quick example for it. Let’s imagine you want to make a search box that will give the suggestions according to text to the user. Will you make a query in your database when the user hit to the keyboard every time? Of course, no! Because it’ll hurt your database, right? You need to defer making query until the user stopped to typing.\nYou can say, make a query when if the user won’t type anything in  500ms. It’s <strong>debouncing</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Throttle</strong> will run after every <strong>X</strong> time.</p>\n<p><strong>Debounce</strong> will run only once when an event is done.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There is also a great demo to fully demonstrate how they work.</p>\n<p>You can check it out: <a href=\"http://demo.nimius.net/debounce_throttle\" target=\"_blank\">Throttle - Debounce Demo</a></p>"}
