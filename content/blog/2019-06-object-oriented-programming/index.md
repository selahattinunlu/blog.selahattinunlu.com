Object Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects.
Objects are instance of the classes. Classes are kind of data structure that holds
data in their attributes. Except holding data, it has procedures. In object oriented programming,
we call them as methods. And classes can manipulate data, communicate with the other classes using that methods.

It has some cool features like abstraction, encapsulation (data-hiding), inheritance, polymorphism.
We'll talk about, be patient! :)
