### What is S.O.L.I.D?

Solid is an acronym for **object-oriented design principles** by **Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)**

They help the developers to create easily maintainable, extendable software. Because that principles appeared after a long experiences. The problems today we encountered was encountered by Robert C. Martin already. So, these principles may seems like a guide to prevent common issues.

### S.O.L.I.D stands for what?

- S: Single Responsibility
- O: Open / Closed
- L: Liskov substitution
- I: Interface segregation
- D: Dependency Inversion

### Single Responsiblity

<div class="bg-gray-200 p-5 rounded-lg mt-4 mb-4">
A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
</div>

### Open Closed

<div class="bg-gray-200 p-5 rounded-lg mt-4 mb-4">
Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
</div>

### Liskov substitution

<div class="bg-gray-200 p-5 rounded-lg mt-4 mb-4">
A sub-class must be substitutable for its super-class
</div>

```php
class VideoPlayer {
    public function play($file)
    {
        echo 'Video playing...';
    }
}

class AviVideoPlayer extends VideoPlayer {
    public function play($file)
    {
        if (pathinfo($file, PATHINFO_EXTENSION) !== 'avi') {
            throw new Exception;
        }

        echo 'Video playing...';
    }
}
```

The code above violates the Liskov Substitution. Because if we use `AviVideoPlayer` instead of `VideoPlayer` in somewhere, it might behaves different in some case. But according to the principle, it should behave exactly same!

### Interface Segregation

<div class="bg-gray-200 p-5 rounded-lg mt-4 mb-4">
A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
</div>

```php
interface Worker {
    public function work();
    public function sleep();
}

class Person implements Worker {
    public function work()
    {
        echo 'Person is working..';
    }

    public function sleep()
    {
        echo 'Person is sleeping...';
    }
}

class Robot implements Worker {
    public function work()
    {
        echo 'Robot is working...';
    }

    public function sleep()
    {
        //
    }
}
```

As you can see, robot does not need to sleep. But we've forced to implementing `sleep` method. So it violates the Interface Segregation principle. Let's fix it.

```php
interface Worker {
    public function work();
}

interface Sleepable {
    public function sleep();
}

class Person implements Worker, Sleepable {
    public function work()
    {
        echo 'Person is working..';
    }

    public function sleep()
    {
        echo 'Person is sleeping...';
    }
}

class Robot implements Worker {
    public function work()
    {
        echo 'Robot is working...';
    }
}
```

### Dependency Inversion

<div class="bg-gray-200 p-5 rounded-lg mt-4 mb-4">
Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
</div>

All of this is about decoupling code.

```php
<?php

class PasswordReminder {
    __construct(MysqlConnection $connection) {
        //
    }
}
```

It depends directly to concrete low-level module. It violates the Dependency Inversion. Let's fix it.

```php
interface DatabaseConnection {
    //
}

class MysqlConnection implements DatabaseConnection {

}

class PasswordReminder {
    __construct(DatabaseConnection $connection) {
        //
    }
}
```

Right now, `PasswordReminder` depends on abstraction and also low-level module (MysqlConnection) too depends on abstraction!
