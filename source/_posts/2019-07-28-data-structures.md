Data structure is a format to storage, manage, organize the data. 

##Â Stacks

Stack stores the data in linear order. The order could be FIFO (First in First Out) or LIFO (Last in First Out).

Stacks could have these functions on it: 

- **push:** to add new item to end of stack
- **pop:** to remove the last item of stack
- **peek:** to display the last item of stack
- **length:** to display how many items the stack has.


## Set

Set is kind of array except there no duplicated items. And there is no any particular order.

Set has following methods commonly:

- **has:** to determine whether the item is inside the set
- **values:** to return all the values the item has
- **add:** to add new items to the set but first, it will check the item whether if it is exists already
- **remove** to remove the item from the set
- **size** to display how many items the set has
- **union** to return combination of two sets without duplication as a new set
- **intersection** to return the insersection of two sets as a new set
- **difference** to return the difference of two sets as a new set
- **subset** to test if the set is a subset of the other set or not
